Machine learning classification project with the main goal of predicting flight arrival delay.
Implemented models include Decision tree, Naive Bayes and Random Forrest algorithms and their performance
was evaluated using different model evaluation metrics.
The original dataset, "Airline Delay and Cancellation Data, 2009 - 2018" was downloaded from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yuanyuwendymu/airline-delay-and-cancellation-data-2009-2018?datasetId=297485&language=null

In this project, data from the year 2017. was used.
The file sample_dataset.RDS contains preprocessed data, that was prepared for model usage. Data analysis and preprocessing
can be found in the Skripta.R file.
Different R scripts were created for every implemented algorithm, and a Source.R file was created
for commonly used functions.
